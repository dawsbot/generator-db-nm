:metal::tada:Thank you for helping with <%= moduleName %>! :tada::metal:

Development from people like you makes projects great. In order to make cool things like we all want to, there are a few basic things to follow.

<br>

1. If the patch/ PR is small, hack it out and see if the community likes it.
2. On the other hand, if it is large, ask me about it first. We don't want to see time wasted on things that won't get merged or are already underway

<br>

### Lint and test
* Lint with [xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)
* Test with [ava](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava)

Keep in mind that all of this configuration is already done for you, so setup your workflow to lint with xo and you're ready!

```js
npm test
```

<br>

If you have any doubts just reach out and say "oh hai".

Cheers! :beers:
