# Contributing to <%= moduleName %>

:metal::tada: Thank you for helping with <%= moduleName %>! :tada::metal:

Development from people like you makes projects great. In order to make cool things like we all want to, there are a few basic things to follow.

<br>
**PR's should be in response to an issue**. Please open an issue before posting your PR

1. If the patch/pull request is small, hack it out and see if the community likes it.
2. If it is large, ask about it first in an issue. We don't want to see time wasted on things that won't get merged or are already underway

<br>

### Lint and test
* Lint with [xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)
* Test with [ava](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava)

```js
npm test // performs both xo linting and ava testing
```

<br>

Reach out with questions!

Cheers! :beers:
